# Josh's Market Data Downloader

Welcome to a personal project I am working on to download financial market data and store it locally to a PostgreSQL database.

The eventual goal for this project is to build it into a basic algorithmic trading bot able to be linked to a brokerage account.

## Functionality

Basic functionality to request market data through [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and store it within appropriately defined tables within a PostgreSQL database.

In progress development includes:
- Ability to chose requests and navigate app functionality through a terminal window.
- Ability to request historical data for a number of tickers at once.
- Additional types of data requests.

## Dependencies

- Python
- PostgreSQL
- [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) API

## Contributing

Feel free to create pull requests and/or issues, they will be reviewed as I have time.
